#summary Description of concordion-ant-task by bad.robot

= Generate a Concordion Overview Page =

The [http://code.google.com/p/badrobot/downloads/list concordion-ant-task-x.jar] contains a custom Ant task collect [http://www.concordion.org/ Concordion] test specs into a single overview page to be run with Concordion (using the {{{Run}}} command.

Use this as part of your build process to ensure *all* test htmls are run and summarised from a central starting point.

= Recommended Build Process =

Follow the recommended build process in your Ant script to leverage the awesome synergies of the power puff girls...

  # Clean everything
  # Compile everything
  # Collect Concordion tests into an overview page (see below)
  # Run unit (and other non-Concordion tests), exclude all Concordion tests (and the overview page)
  # Run just the generated Concordion overview page (and so all your Concordion tests)

Because the overview page is generated *every* time your run the build, the generated overview page will include all Concordion tests (selected by your user defined filter).

= Dependencies = 

Available to Ant, you must have

  # {{{concordion-ant-task-x.jar}}}
  # FreeMarker (lets say, version 2.3.16)


= Collecting Concordion Tests with Ant =

Setup your build file with the task.

{{{
<taskdef name="generate-test-overview" classname="bad.robot.concordion.ant.GenerateTestOverviewTask"/>
}}}

(having copied {{{concordion-ant-task-x.jar}}} into $ANT_HOME/lib or reference it in the {{{taskdef}}} above by some other [http://ant.apache.org/manual/Tasks/typedef.html Ant] mechanism).

then generate your overview page during your build

{{{
    <target name="generate-overview">
        <generate-test-overview template="Overview.ftl" output="Overview.html">
            <fileset dir="${basedir}" includes="**/specs/**/*.html"/>
        </generate-test-overview>
    </target>
}}}

all that's left is to run your newly generated Overview.html as a Concordion test. Ensure that you have a corresponding Java test ({{{@RunWith(ConcordionRunner.class)}}}) with the same name as your overview page (in our example, {{{Overview.jara}}}, then...

{{{
    <target name="run.acceptance.tests" depends="generate-overview">
        <junit printsummary="yes" haltonfailure="yes">
            <formatter type="plain"/>
            <test name="Overview"/>
        </junit>
    </target>
}}}

(Make sure you setup a filter that will only run the single {{{Overview}}} as a test, not all the Concordion tests).
