# Introduction #

The Dipped in Dinosaur Doodoo project is an attempt to pull together the authors understanding of Domain Driven Design into something re-usable across projects. It contains common implementations and ideas as well as some utility programs that pull together meta-information about projects using the classes and annotations (such as a project dictionary, generated from the code). It also offers some ideas from the broader perspective like decorative transactions (that you can use to bash the Spring boys over the head with by way of example).

The name comes from the fact that most of the ideas are fairly old and the authors implementation is likely to be shite.

Work in progress so don't expect great things.
