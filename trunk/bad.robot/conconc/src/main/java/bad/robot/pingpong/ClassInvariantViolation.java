/**
 * Methods of the class should preserve any class invariants. The class invariant constrains the state stored in the
 * object and should be constantly maintained between calls to public methods. An object invariant, or representation
 * invariant, is a programming construct consisting of a set of invariant properties that remain uncompromised
 * regardless of the state of the object. This ensures that the object will always meet predefined conditions,
 * and that methods may, therefore, always reference the object without the risk of making inaccurate presumptions.
 *
 * This exception is used to explicitly capture invariants and force run time exceptions if they are violated. Use
 * this rather than the <code>assert</code> keyword if you don't want to conditionally check invariants (ie, you wont
 * need to -enableassertions flag on the VM).
 *
