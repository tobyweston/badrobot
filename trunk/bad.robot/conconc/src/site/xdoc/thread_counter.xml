        <section name="Instrumenting Thread Usage">

            <p>
                One area that was identified as an opportunity to explore shared access was around instrumenting thread
                usage within the system. The requirement being around understanding the cumulative number of threads created
                and the currently active threads (threads started but not yet terminated).
            </p>

            <subsection name="Shared Infrastructure">
                <p>
                    The ultimate goal was to create alternative implementations of something that can be used to
                    instrument thread usage within the system, one pessimistic / lock based implementation and an alternative
                    optimistic implementation. It makes sense if these competing implementations follow a similar
                    approach so that they can be swapped easily for comparison.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The role of collecting or processing this information can be seen in terms of an
                    <i>observer</i>, for example,
                </p>
<source>
public interface ThreadObserver {
    void threadCreated();
    void threadStarted();
    void threadTerminated();
}

            <p>
                Java's <code>ThreadFactory</code> is a natural place to make observations about thread activity. All that
                would be required is for the application to be wired up to use the following thread factory and we can
                start our instrumentation.
            </p>
<source>
public class ObservableThreadFactory implements ThreadFactory {

    private final ThreadObserver observer;

    public ObservableThreadFactory(ThreadObserver observer) {
        this.observer = observer;
    }

        Thread thread = new Thread(new Runnable() {

                This section talks about the lock based implementation an observer called <code>ThreadCounter</code> and
                its evolution.

                <p>
                    A naive implementation of the <code>ThreadCounter</code> class might look like this

            <p>
                The basic test below shows the implementation to be correct (at least in a non-concurrent context).

        <p align="center"><b><i>Fig 5.4. Basic single-thread behavioural unit test</i></b></p>
        <h4>Testing Thread Safety</h4>
        <p>
            The next test shows that it isn't correct from a concurrent context. Here, the
            <a href="http://code.google.com/p/tempus-fugit/wiki/Documentation?tm=6">tempus-fugit</a> micro-library
            is used to run each test method repeatedly over several threads. Specifically, each of the test methods are
            run one hundred times (thanks to the <code>RepeatingRule</code> rule) in fifty threads
            (thanks to the <code>ConcurrentRule</code> rule along with the <code>count</code> variable).
            To kick this off for each test method at the <i>same time</i>, the <code>ConcurrentTestRunner</code> is used.
            Otherwise, each of the test methods will run in their own threads, repeatedly but in sequence (ie,
            <code>notifyThreadStarted</code> would run, then <code>notifyThreadTerminated</code> and so on). Adding
            the <code>@RunWith</code> means that each test method is kicked off in its own thread at roughly the same time.
        </p>
        <p>
            Separating a functionally correctness test from a thread-safety style test meant that the two concerns could
            stay separate during testing and development.
        </p>
<source>
@RunWith(<b><font color="red">ConcurrentTestRunner.class</font></b>)
public class ThreadCounterIntegrationTest {

    private static final ThreadCounter counter = new ThreadCounter();

    @Rule public <b><font color="red">ConcurrentRule</font></b> concurrent = new ConcurrentRule();
    @Rule public <b><font color="red">RepeatingRule</font></b> repeating = new RepeatingRule();

    @Test
    @Repeating
    @Concurrent(count = 50)
    public void notifyThreadStarted() {
        counter.threadStarted();
        Introduce.jitter();
    }

    @Test
    @Repeating
    @Concurrent(count = 10)
    public void notifyThreadTerminated() {
        counter.threadTerminated();
        Introduce.jitter();
    }

    @Test
    @Repeating
    @Concurrent(count = 50)
    public void notifyThreadCreated() {
        counter.threadCreated();
        Introduce.jitter();
    }

    @AfterClass
    public static void verifyCounter() {
        assertThat(counter.getCreatedCount(), is(5000L));
        assertThat(counter.getActiveCount(), is(4000L));
    }
}
</source>
        <p align="center"><b><i>Fig 5.5. Multi-threaded test highlighting concurrency problems</i></b></p>
        <p>
            The call to <code>Introduce.jitter()</code> introduces a pseudo-random delay of up to five milliseconds.
            This is designed to try and avoid deterministic behaviour and exaggerate the affect of the tests.
        </p>
        <p>
            The first assertion is expecting a created count of five thousand (having called <code>threadCreated</code> one
            hundred times over fifty threads). The second assertion also ensures that <code>threadTerminated</code> affects
            the active count (it will be run one hundred times over ten threads). The default number of repetitions from
            the <code>RepeatingRule</code> is one hundred.
        </p>
        <h4>Testing Invariants</h4>
        <p>
            The above test is designed to load the class under test so heavily that it is <i>reasonably likely</i> to
            fail the assertions (in <code>verifyCounter()</code>). It doesn't however test the invariant around the
            <code>reset</code> method. It could be argued that if <code>reset</code> is called, it should reset both
            <code>activeThreads</code> and <code>createdThreads</code> atomically. That is to say, no additional updates
            should be allowed to either variable until both have been set to zero.
        </p>
        <p>
            Testing the invariant directly proved too difficult to do, it was just too hard to simulate the race
            condition between resetting and setting multiple variables. However, as well see, the natural progression
            of the implementation lead to an alternative strategy which ensures the invariant is maintained.
        </p>
        <h4>Making <code>ThreadCounter</code> Thread Safe</h4>
        <p>
            Making the class thread safe (and passing the previous tests) was pretty straight forward using the <code>AtomicLong</code>
            class.
        </p>
<source>
@ThreadSafe
public class ThreadCounter implements ThreadObserver {

    private final <b><font color="red">AtomicLong</font></b> activeThreads = new AtomicLong();
    private final <b><font color="red">AtomicLong</font></b> createdThreads = new AtomicLong();

    @Override
    public void threadCreated() {
        createdThreads.getAndIncrement();
    }

    @Override
    public void threadStarted() {
        activeThreads.getAndIncrement();
    }

    @Override
    public void threadTerminated() {
        activeThreads.getAndDecrement();
    }

    @Override
    public long getActiveCount() {
        return activeThreads.get();
    }

    @Override
    public long getCreatedCount() {
        return createdThreads.get();
    }

    @Override
    public void reset() {
        activeThreads.set(0);
        createdThreads.set(0);
    }
}
</source>
         <p align="center"><b><i>Fig 5.6. Thread safe version of the ThreadCounter</i></b></p>
         <p>
             At this point, the class is thread safe but the invariant around the <code>reset</code> method is still
             not maintained (or tested). A simple fix might be to use the <code>synchronized</code> keyword on <i>all</i>
             of the methods (at which point, we'd no longer need to the <code>AtomicLong</code>s). This is explored in
             the below.

            <p>
                This revision attempts to maintain the invariant using Java <code>Lock</code>s and at the same encapsulate
                the use of the locks in a separate class (<code>ExecuteUsingLock</code>) to ensure consistent behaviour. The
                unfortunate verbosity of using <code>Callable</code> objects to achieve this is addressed later. For now,
                the helper class looks like this
            </p>
<source>
public class ExecuteUsingLock&lt;T, E extends Exception&gt; {

    private final Callable&lt;T, E&gt; callable;

    private ExecuteUsingLock(Callable&lt;T, E&gt; callable) {
        this.callable = callable;
    }

    public static &lt;T, E extends Exception&gt; ExecuteUsingLock&lt;T, E&gt; execute(Callable&lt;T, E&gt; callable) {
        return new ExecuteUsingLock&lt;T, E&gt;(callable);
    }

    public T using(Lock lock) throws E {
        try {
            lock.lock();
            return callable.call();
        } finally {
            lock.unlock();
        }
    }
}
</source>
        <p align="center"><b><i>Fig 5.8. Execute Callables ensuring lock and unlock semantics</i></b></p>
        <p>
            By using the same lock to guard all the write methods, we're effectively implementing a class equivilant to
            one that synchronises on all the write methods. It becomes more serial than previous revisions (ie, you
            can't call <code>threadStarted</code> at the same time as <code>threadTerminated</code>). It's up to you, to
            decide if that's a big deal or not.
        </p>
        <p>
            The <code>reset</code> method has been implemented to try and acquire the lock before actually executing the
            reset functionality. This is an attempt to optimise the reset and isn't really necessary unless you've
            tested and identified it as a bottleneck. It's here really as part of the academic exercise.
        </p>
        <p>
            As the same lock is used when writing (including the reset), there's no need to lock on the read
            as the underlying <code>AtomicLong</code> will ensure visibility of any successful writes. As discussed, we
            could avoid the use of locks completely by synchronising all the methods and if we dropped the <code>AtomicLong</code>s
            in favour of <code>long</code>s, we could make the variables <code>volatile</code> to ensure visibility. These
            alternatives are roughly equivalent but by exposing the lock in this revision we can create a test using mock
            objects that separates the synchronisation policy from the functionality of the class.

        <h4>Tidying Up</h4>
        <p>
            A quick tidy up saw me push the anonymous <code>Callable</code> objects into their own classes and reduce the

        <h4>Building out the <code>Guard</code> Interface</h4>
        <p>
            There are some limitations with the current implementation, notably the inability to test the invariant. We
            also know that we ultimately want to create a counter that isn't limited to a pessimistic locking strategy.
            The idea of <i>guarding</i> shared memory seems to be abstract enough to imply non-lock based solutions, so
            I created a basic <code>Gaurd</code> interface.
        </p>
<source>
public interface Guard {

    &lt;R, E extends Exception&gt; R execute(Callable&lt;R, E&gt; callable) throws E;

    Boolean guarding();
}
</source>
        <p align="center"><b><i>Fig 5.13. The Guard class</i></b></p>
        <p>
            The basic lock based implementation of which is shown below
        </p>
<source>
public class LockingGuard implements Guard {

    private final Lock lock;

    public LockingGuard(Lock lock) {
        this.lock = lock;
    }

    @Override
    public &lt;R, E extends Exception&gt; R execute(Callable&lt;R, E&gt; callable) throws E {
        try {
            lock.lock();
            return callable.call();
        } finally {
            lock.unlock();
        }
    }

    @Override
    public Boolean guarding() {
        return acquired(lock);
    }
}    
</source>
        <p align="center"><b><i>Fig 5.14. The Lock based guard</i></b></p>
        <p>
            This opens several opportunities for the improving the current implementation, specifically around testing
            individual components in isolation and finally creating a test to ensure the invariant in maintained. The first
            step is to refactor the <code>ThreadCounter</code> to use the <code>Guard</code>.
        </p>
<source>
@ThreadSafe
public class ThreadCounter implements ThreadObserver {

    private final AtomicLong activeThreads = new AtomicLong();
    private final AtomicLong createdThreads = new AtomicLong();
    private final Guard guard;

    public ThreadCounter(Guard guard) {
        this.guard = guard;
    }

    @Override
    public void threadCreated() {
        guard.execute(increment(createdThreads));
    }

    @Override
    public void threadStarted() {
        guard.execute(increment(activeThreads));
    }

    @Override
    public void threadTerminated() {
        guard.execute(decrement(activeThreads));
    }

    @Override
    public long getActiveCount() {
        return activeThreads.get();
    }

    @Override
    public long getCreatedCount() {
        return createdThreads.get();
    }

    @Override
    public void reset() {
        if (guard.guarding())
            guard.execute(resetOf(activeThreads, createdThreads));
    }
}
</source>
        <p>
            and in order to test the original <code>ThreadCounterTest</code> (which shouldn't be concerned with thread 
            safety), a dummy <code>Guard</code> is implemented. Notice this just delegates to the <code>Callable</code>
            object.
        </p>
<source>
public class Unguarded implements Guard {

    public static Guard unguarded() {
        return new Unguarded();
    }

    @Override
    public &lt;R, E extends Exception&gt; R execute(Callable&lt;R, E&gt; callable) throws E {
        return callable.call();
    }

    @Override
    public Boolean guarding() {
        return true;
    }
}    
</source>
    <p>
        This allows the original test to be unaffected
    </p>
<source>
public class ThreadCounterTest {
    
    private final ThreadCounter counter = new ThreadCounter(unguarded());
    ...
}
</source>
    <p>
        We can also change tact when it comes to testing the invariant. Rather than try and reproduce the race condition,
        it's sufficient to ensure that the same <code>Guard</code> is used for write and reset methods. Assuming the
        runtime guard implementation has been tested, a test to ensure the same guard is used for all of the methods
        ensures the invariant will be maintained. This is very implementation specific but given the race condition
        proved too difficult to reproduce, it's a sensible compromise.

        <h4>Taking it Further with <code>Counter</code>s</h4>
        <p>
            Using the <code>Guard</code> abstraction is interesting but doesn't give us very much other than allowing
            alternative guard implementations. The current <code>LockGuard</code> uses a <code>Lock</code>
            and we could supply an alternative that uses <code>synchronized</code> but we don't gain much. As long as
            we use the same guard instance, we'll get consistent behaviour between implementations. For example,
        </p>
<source>
public class SynchronisingGuard implements Guard {

    public static Guard synchronised() {
        return new SynchronisingGuard();
    }

    @Override
    public synchronized &lt;R, E extends Exception&gt; R execute(Callable&lt;R, E&gt; callable) throws E {
        return callable.call();
    }

    @Override
    public Boolean guarding() {
        return true;
    }
}    
</source>
        <p>
            What might be more useful is to come up with a <code>Counter</code> abstract to separate the increment and
            decrement functions from the classes that use them from the guarding policy that controls their access. For
            example,
        </p>
<source>
public interface Counter {
    void increment();
    void decrement();
    Long get();
    void reset();
}
</source>
        <p>
            With an example implementation of
        </p>
<source>
public class LongCounter implements Counter {

    private Long count = new Long(0);

    @Override
    public void increment() {
        count++;
    }

    @Override
    public void decrement() {
        count--;
    }

    @Override
    public Long get() {
        return count;
    }

    @Override
    public void reset() {
        count = new Long(0);
    }
}
</source>
        <p>
            or an atomic version
        </p>
<source>
public class AtomicLongCounter implements Counter {

    private volatile final AtomicLong count = new AtomicLong();

    @Override
    public void increment() {
        count.getAndIncrement();
    }

    @Override
    public void decrement() {
        count.getAndDecrement();
    }

    @Override
    public void reset() {
        count.set(0);
    }

    public Long get() {
        return count.get();
    }
}
</source>
        <p>
            Which means we can change the <code>ThreadCounter</code> to take the dependencies on construction.
        </p>
<source>
@ThreadSafe
public class ThreadCounter implements ThreadObserver {

    private final Counter activeThreads;
    private final Counter createdThreads;
    private final Guard guard;

    public ThreadCounter(Guard guard, Counter activeThreads, Counter createdThreads) {
        this.guard = guard;
        this.activeThreads = activeThreads;
        this.createdThreads = createdThreads;
    }

    ...
}
</source>
        <p>
            We can therefore construct a <code>ThreadCounter</code> with different semantics when it comes to use from
            a concurrent context. For example,
        </p>
<source>
public static ThreadObserver createLockBasedThreadSafeCounter() {
    return new ThreadCounter(new LockingGuard(new ReentrantLock()), new LongCounter(), new LongCounter());
}
</source>
        <p>
            creates a thread safe thread counter using the reentrant lock to ensure the invariant around reset is maintained.
            The visibility of writes against the (non-thread safe) <code>LongCounter</code> can be ensured by the
            <code>volatile</code> keyword in <code>LongCounter</code>.
        </p>
<source>
public static ThreadObserver createThreadSafeCounterWithoutMaintainingResetInvariant() {
    return new ThreadCounter(unguarded(), new AtomicLongCounter(), new AtomicLongCounter());
}
</source>
        <p>
            The above statement creates a thread counter which is thread safe (by virtue of the <code>AtomicLongCounter</code>s)
            but doesn't maintain the invariant. The unguarded <code>Guard</code> doesn't include any synchronisation.
        </p>
<source>
public static ThreadObserver createSynchronisedThreadSafeCounter() {
    return new ThreadCounter(synchronised(), new LongCounter(), new LongCounter());
}
</source>
        <p>
            The above statement is roughly equivalent, it creates a thread safe thread counter but uses a Java monitor
            rather than a <code>Lock</code> for its guarding policy. It maintains the invariant as before. The
            <code>synchronised</code> method is the static creation method for <code>SynchronisingGuard</code> class.
        </p>
<source>
public static ThreadObserver createNonThreadSafeCounter() {
    return new ThreadCounter(unguarded(), new LongCounter(), new LongCounter());
}
</source>
        <p>
           The above statement creates a non-thread safe version.
        </p>

        <p>
            The original functionality test can also be updated to use mocks (as the increment functionality can be
            tested separately in the <code>Counter</code> implementations. For example, using JMock, we can ensure
            increment and decrement functionality is called against a <code>Counter</code> instance.

        <subsection name="Optimistic / Software Transaction Memory">
            <p>
                In principle, a Software Transactional Memory (STM) version of the <code>ThreadCounter</code> should
                isolate access to the shared memory (the <code>Counters</code> in our case) such that the integrity of
                that access is maintained even from a concurrent context. The existing concurrent tests should all pass.
            </p>
            <p>
                Using an STM based implementation of the <code>ThreadCounter</code>'s <code>Guard</code>, we can slot
                straight into the unit of work that the guard defines. In this way, the gaurd is no longer protecting
                or synchronising access but instead defining actions that will form an atomic unit of work.
            </p>
            <p>
                For example, the snippet below shows how the <code>guard</code> co-ordinates access to decrement the
                counter.
            </p>
<source>
public void threadTerminated() {
    guard.execute(<i>decrement</i>(activeThreads));
}
</source>
            <p>
                When an STM implementation of the <code>guard</code> is used, we can define our unit of work. For example,
            </p>
<source>
public class StmGuard implements Guard {
    public &lt;R, E extends Exception&gt; R execute(Callable&lt;R, E&gt; callable) throws E {
        return <i>runAtomically</i>(callable);
    }
} </source>
            <p>
                Where the <code>runAtomically</code> method delegates to the underlying STM library. In this case, we're using
                the <a href="http://multiverse.codehaus.org/">Multiverse STM library</a> as the underlying library and
                <a href="http://doc.akka.io/stm-java">Akka</a> STM to provide some neater abstractions.
            </p>
<source>
    public class RunAtomically&lt;R, E extends Exception&gt; extends Atomic&lt;R&gt; {

        private final Callable&lt;R, E&gt; callable;

        public static &lt;R, E extends Exception&gt; R runAtomically(Callable&lt;R, E&gt; callable) {
            return new RunAtomically&lt;R, E&gt;(callable).execute();
        }

        public RunAtomically(Callable&lt;R, E&gt; callable) {
            this.callable = callable;
        }

        @Override
        public R atomically() {
            try {
                return callable.call();
            } catch (Exception e) {
                throw new RuntimeException(e);
            }
        }
    }    
</source>
            <p>
                A call to the is basically equivalent to the following (minus the exception handling).
            </p>
<source>
new Atomic&lt;R&gt;() {
    return callable.call();
}.execute();
</source>
        </subsection>
            <p>
                So the above defines the unit of work but any shared memory to be included in the transaction has to be
                defined as a <i>transactional reference</i>. This is done by defining them as a <code>Ref</code> instance.
                For example, to make use of the new <code>StmGuard</code> we would have to combine them with a
                <code>Counter</code> as a <i>transactional reference.</i>
            </p>
<source>
@Not(ThreadSafe.class)
public class TransactionalReferenceCounter implements Counter {

    private final Ref&lt;Long&gt; count = new Ref&lt;Long&gt;(0L);

        count.set(count.get() + 1L);
    }

</source>
            <p>
                As you'll notice, this class in itself isn't thread safe, nor is the <code>StmGuard</code>. However,
                when they're combined with the <code>ThreadCounter</code> they'll pass all our previously defined tests
                (including the concurrent ones). Therefore, the class construction below represents a thread safe
                <code>ThreadCounter</code> that will also maintain the invariant.
            </p>
<source>
static ThreadObserver createThreadSafeCounterMaintainingInvariant() {
    return new ThreadCounter(new StmGuard(), new TransactionalReferenceCounter(), new TransactionalReferenceCounter());
} </source>
            <p>
                If we consider an implementation similar to the pessimistic 
                <code>createThreadSafeCounterWithoutMaintainingResetInvariant</code> we can bypass the guard and implement
                atomicity around the individual mutators as below.
