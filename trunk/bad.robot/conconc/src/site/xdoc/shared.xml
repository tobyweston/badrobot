                    Distributed Memory is the idea that in multi-core processors (or in single-core multiple processor
                    systems), each core/processor has local memory and works on it with exclusivity. If a task is
                    required to collaborate with other core's memory, it must communicate with them as an external
                    resource.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There is also the idea of distributed yet shared memory.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Are Actors an example?
