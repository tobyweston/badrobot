                    In the pessimistic world, contended locks obviously block. The misconception that locking is expensive
                    comes from this where in fact uncontended locks add only tens of nanoseconds (biased locking at around
                    2-4 clock cycles and fast user-model locks otherwise). This is all highly optimised by the JVM as
                    synchronisation has been so common in development. Things like lock elision, escape analysis, adaptive
                    locking and lock coarsening all aim to correct the oversights of the developer. These optimisations
                    and the support for the pessimistic model from the language have set its place and we won't be seeing
                    it go away for some time yet.
